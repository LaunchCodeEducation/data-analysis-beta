### Data Cleaning Defined

Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies in a **dataset**. It is an important step in the data analysis process because dirty data can lead to incorrect conclusions and flawed analysis.Some common issues that need to be addressed during data cleaning include:

* Missing values: Missing values can occur when a value is not recorded or is recorded as "null" or "NA". Missing values can be a problem because they can affect the results of statistical analyses.
* Outliers: Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the majority of the data. They can skew the results of an analysis if they are not identified and handled appropriately.
* Duplicate records: Duplicate records can occur when the same data is recorded multiple times in a dataset. These records need to be identified and removed to avoid double counting.
* Inconsistent formatting: Inconsistent formatting can make it difficult to analyze data. For example, if some values are recorded as "Yes" and others as "YES", this can cause problems when trying to count or group the data.

Data cleaning is often a time-consuming process, but it is essential for ensuring that the data is accurate and ready for analysis.
