### Defining Data 

What is data? Data can be consider as the facts and statistics collected together for reference, review or analysis. 
So we can infer that data analysis is the process of examining and evaluating data in order to extract insights, answer questions, and make data informed decisions.  

### Types of Data 

It involves applying statistical and analytical techniques on a given collection of data (also known as a **dataset)** in order to identify patterns, trends, and relationships. Data analysis is used in a wide range of fields, including business, finance, healthcare, social sciences, and many others. It is an essential skill for anyone who works with data and is interested in understanding and interpreting it. It includes two main types of data: **numerical** and **categorical data**. **Numerical data** is data that can be measured or quantified. It is further divided into two types:

1. Continuous data and 
2. Discrete data

**Continuous** data can take on any value within a certain range, such as weight or height. Height is a continuous data type because it can take on any value within a certain range. For example, someone's height could be 5 feet 3 inches (63 inches), 5 feet 4 inches (64 inches), or any other value within the range of possible heights for humans.

**Discrete data** can only take on specific, distinct values, such as the number of students in a class.The number of students in a class is a discrete data type because it can only take on specific, distinct values. 

For example, a class might have 17 students, 18 students, or any other whole number of students, but it cannot have 17.5 students or any other value between two whole numbers.

**Categorical data** is data that can be placed into categories. It is also referred to as qualitative data. Categorical data is often represented by labels or names, rather than numbers. Examples include gender, type of product, and favorite color. There is also a third type of data called Ordinal data, which is a combination of numerical and categorical data. 

**Ordinal data** is data that can be ranked or ordered, but the difference between the values is not necessarily equal. An example of ordinal data is a survey response that asks people to rate something on a scale from 1 to 10. It is important to understand the type of data you are working with because different types of data require different methods of analysis.

## Looking Ahead At Machine Learning

### What is machine learning (ML)

**Machine learning** is a type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. 

It involves training a computer model on a dataset, and then using the model to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly told how to do so. There are two main types of machine learning: **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**.   

In **supervised learning**, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that the data has been labeled with the correct output. 

For example, a **supervised learning** model might be trained on a dataset of images that have been labeled as "cat" or "dog". The model is then able to use the labels to make predictions on new, unseen data.

In **unsupervised learning**, the model is not given any labels and must find patterns and relationships in the data on its own. An example of unsupervised learning is clustering, where the model groups similar data points together.

Machine learning is used in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.

For example, Imagine you are a social media company with a large online user base. You want to improve the experience of your customers by suggesting friends and content that they might be interested in based on their past likes and shares.

One way to do this is to use machine learning to build a recommendation system. You can train a machine learning model on a dataset of past customer shares, likes and comments and product purchases. 

The model can then learn to predict what new content  a customer is most likely to be interested in based on their past purchases and the characteristics of the new content.

When a customer visits your website, the recommendation system can use the trained model to suggest content to them. The recommendations can be based on the customer's past shares, likes and comments, as well as other customers who have shared, liked or purchased similar products.

This is just one example of how machine learning can be used to improve the customer experience, drive engagement and sales. There are many other examples of machine learning being used in the real world, including credit fraud detection (used by major credit card companies such as Mastercard, Visa, Discovery etc), spam filtering (yahoo, gmail etc), and predictive maintenance in manufacturing.  Targeted ads are also being used to show you related products over multiple devices using a combination of cookies, sessions, search history and machine learning to drive customer sales for many companies.  Machine learning is a type of data analysis that involves using algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
