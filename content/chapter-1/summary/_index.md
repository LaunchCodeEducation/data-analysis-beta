### Session 1 Summary of Course Introduction

Data analysis is the process of examining and evaluating data in order to extract insights, answer questions, and inform decision making. It involves applying statistical and analytical techniques to a dataset in order to identify patterns, trends, and relationships. These insights can be used to create reports and dashboard and help drive decision making within an organization. It includes two main types of data,  numerical (which can be continuous or discrete) and categorical (which can also be ordinal) and two types of statistical models descriptive and Inferential. Data cleaning is a critical component of data analysis and is the process of identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies in a given dataset.
