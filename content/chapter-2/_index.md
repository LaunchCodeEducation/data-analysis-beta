### Tools for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This chapter outline provides an introduction to the tools and common programming languages and software tools associated with data analytic. There are many other tools that can be used that we do not cover in an attempt to consolidate the learning into the fundamentals and art forms of metacognition (thinking about thinking). Later chapters will attempt to provide you with the tools necessary to think about how to approach data problems that you can apply to most situations. Once youâ€™ve completed this chapter, you should be able to describe the following topics:

* What common tools are associated with data analytics
* The difference between PowerBI and Tableau 
* What is data visualization? 
* What are common questions for data visualization to get started? 
* What is exploratory data analysis? 
* Reading data in a comma-separated value CVS
* Identify common tools used for data visualization and data analysis 
* Identify popular programming languages for data analysis and visualizations
