### What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is an approach to analyzing and understanding data that involves summarizing and visualizing the data, as well as identifying patterns, trends, and relationships. We have covered this in the statistical regression model in the education and income dataset. One of the goals of EDA is to better understand the data and identify any important features or relationships that may not be obvious or apparent to stakeholders. 

EDA is typically the first step in the data analysis process and is used to inform the design and development of more formal analyses and models. It is an iterative process that involves building and testing hypotheses, identifying and addressing any issues or anomalies in the data, and refining the analysis as needed. EDA typically involves using a combination of statistical techniques, graphical displays, and other tools to visualize and summarize the data.
