### What Is PowerBI?

Power BI is a suite of business analytics tools developed by Microsoft that is designed to help users visualize, analyze, and share data. It includes a range of features for data cleansing, transformation, and modeling, as well as a variety of visualization and reporting tools. 

Power BI includes a free desktop application, as well as a cloud-based service that allows users to access their data and reports from anywhere. One of the main advantages of Power BI is its ability to connect to a wide variety of data sources, including Excel, SQL Server, and various cloud-based services, and to combine and transform data from these sources in a variety of ways. It also includes collaboration and sharing tools that make it easy to work with others and share insights with colleagues and stakeholders.
