### What is Plotly? 

[Plotly is a data visualization library](https://plotly.com/python/) for creating interactive charts and graphs. It is available in a number of programming languages, including Python, R, and JavaScript, and can be used to create a wide range of visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and more. One of the main features of Plotly is that it is designed to be highly interactive, allowing users to hover over data points, zoom in on specific areas, and more. It also has the ability to create web-based visualizations that can be easily shared and embedded in websites or other applications. In addition to its charting capabilities, Plotly also includes tools for performing statistical analysis and for creating dashboards and interactive reports.
