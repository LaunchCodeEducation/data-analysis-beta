## Popular Programming Languages for EDA

<!-- To Do  -->




### PowerBI or Tableau? 

The Key difference:

* **Price** Power BI is generally more affordable than Tableau, especially for smaller organizations. Power BI has a free version that includes many of the basic features, as well as paid plans that offer additional capabilities. Tableau has a free trial version, but the full version is more expensive than Power BI.
* **Data Connectivity** Both Power BI and Tableau can connect to a wide variety of data sources, but Power BI has a larger number of native connectors, including connectors to cloud-based data sources such as Azure and Google Analytics. Tableau requires the use of third-party connectors or web data connectors to connect to some data sources.
* **Both** Power BI and Tableau offer a wide range of visualization options, but Tableau is generally considered to be more powerful and flexible in this regard. Tableau offers a larger number of chart types and allows for more customization of visualizations.
* **Collaboration and Sharing** Both Power BI and Tableau offer tools for collaboration and sharing, but Power BI has more robust features in this area. Power BI includes features for commenting and annotation, as well as the ability to publish reports and dashboards to the web and share them with others.
* **Ease of Use** Power BI is generally considered to be easier to use than Tableau, especially for users who are new to data visualization. Tableau has a steeper learning curve but offers more advanced capabilities.

Ultimately, the best choice between Power BI and Tableau will depend on the specific needs and budget of the organization, as well as the level of expertise of the users.  This course uses Tableau.

## Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook while it is not technically a visualization tool it is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is often used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing, and is widely used in the data science community. 

It is an ideal tool for exploring and analyzing data, as well as for sharing your results with others.

## Anaconda 

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning. It includes a wide range of packages and libraries for scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning, as well as tools for managing and deploying Python and R environments. It includes the conda package manager, which can be used to install and manage packages from the Anaconda repository as well as from other repositories. Anaconda is widely used in the data science community and is a popular choice for data scientists and researchers who need a powerful and flexible tool for working with data.

Alternative Tools for EDA

## Alternative Tools for EDA

### Google Sheets 

Google Sheets is a free, web-based spreadsheet application that is part of the Google Docs suite of productivity tools. It allows you to create, edit, and share spreadsheets online, and to work with others in real time. Google Sheets is similar to other spreadsheet applications, such as Microsoft Excel, but is designed to be used online, and includes additional features such as the ability to collaborate with others in real time and to access your spreadsheets from any device with an internet connection. Google Sheets includes a wide range of formatting and data manipulation tools, as well as the ability to use formulas and functions to perform calculations on your data. It is a useful tool for organizing and analyzing data, and is especially well-suited for use in collaborative work environments.

### Microsoft Excel 

Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet application that is part of the Microsoft Office suite of productivity tools. It is available for both Windows and Mac operating systems. Excel allows you to create and edit spreadsheets that contain data, formulas, and functions, as well as to format and customize your data in a variety of ways. Excel is widely used for tasks such as creating budgets, tracking expenses, analyzing data, and performing a wide range of other tasks that involve working with data. Excel includes a wide range of features and tools for data analysis and visualization, including the ability to create charts and graphs, to perform calculations using formulas and functions, and to use pivot tables to analyze and summarize data. It is a powerful and widely-used tool for working with data.

### Google Sheets or Excel? 

The Key Differences: 

**Pricing** Microsoft Excel is a paid software application that is part of the Microsoft Office suite of productivity tools and requires a paid license. Google Sheets is a free, web-based spreadsheet application that is part of the Google Docs suite of productivity tools.

**Availability** Microsoft Excel is available for both Windows and Mac operating systems and can be installed on a local computer. Google Sheets is a web-based application that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection and a web browser.

**Collaboration** Both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets allow you to collaborate with others on spreadsheets, but Google Sheets has more robust collaboration features.

**Data Connectivity** Both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets allow you to connect to a variety of data sources, but Google Sheets has more native connectors, including connectors to cloud-based data sources such as Google Analytics and BigQuery.

**Functionality** Both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets offer a wide range of features and tools for working with data, but Excel is generally considered to be more powerful and feature-rich. Excel includes a larger number of functions and features for data analysis and visualization, and is better suited for more complex tasks.

Ultimately, the best choice between Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets will depend on your specific needs and preferences, as well as the devices and operating systems you are using. For this course we will use Google Sheets because of the benefits described above.

## Session 2: Summary of Popular EDA Tools

There are many tools for Exploratory Data Analysis to help visualize data. Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, PowerBI and Plotly are some of the most popular tools used today in Data Analysis and Data Science. Matplotlib is an EDA visualization tool for Python. Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel or alternative tools for data manipulation and data analysis. The best choice of tools will depend on the organizational needs, budget, availability, personal preference and the learning curve. These Visualization tools allow us to create web-based visualizations that can be easily shared and embedded in websites for public viewing.
