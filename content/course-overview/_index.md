## Business Case 

The purpose of this course is to provide learners with a basic understanding of Data Analysis. Its conception was born from partnerships we have and industry need for Data Analysis professionals. This is a 24 week or 45 week specialized track for job-readiness and apprenticeship training program. This course introduction should provide learners with a strong foundation in Data Analysis and a basic introduction to statistics and put them on the learning track for becoming a Data Science Engineer, Business Analysis or Data Analyst. Other tools like SQL, Google Sheets and Tableau are used and outlined to provide a comprehensive overview of how to analyze data and what a Data Analyst may use at a given time during their professional experience, however the primary focus of this course is the use of Python Pandas library, Jupyter Notebook and Tableau. 

Before getting started you should always review the system requirement and known issues for the software you are installing. This prevents wasting time working on a bug(s) that have already been reported and may have a workaround. [Review Tableau System Requirements](https://www.tableau.com/products/techspecs#desktop) to ensure you have the right system to perform the work required for this class.

## What You Will Learn 

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

* Understand Python basic programming principles 
* Build confidence debugging Jupyter Notebook
* Serve Jupyter notebook files from local directories and connect to their development environment
* Create Pandas Series
* Create Pandas DataFrames
* Understand how to sort DataFrames
